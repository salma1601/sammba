def _perf_fair_read_ptbl(nii_fname):
    """
    Extract perfusion FAIR acquisition parameters (TIs, order of selective and
    non-selective inversions) from the *_ptbl.txt file of a *.nii.gz file. Note
    that both are created simultaneously when sammba.io_conversions.dcm_to_nii
    is used for DICOM to NIfTI-1 conversion. If a different converter was used
    that does not export this data, or does it differently, this function will
    not work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nii_fname : str
        Path to the perfusion *.nii.gz file converted by
        sammba.io_conversions.dcm_to_nii, NOT to the *_ptbl.txt file itself.
        The *_ptbl.txt file name is determined automatically from that of the
        *.nii.gz.

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary of parameters needed for perfusion fitting:
    ti_list:
        simple list of all TIs
    long_ti_list:
        full list of TIs, the same length and in the same order as the
        acquisitions (the final dimension of the NIfTI-1 file)
    fc_list:
        full list of inversion type descriptions ("Selective" or
        "Non-selective"), the same length and in the same order as the
        acquisitions (the final dimension of the NIfTI-1 file). fc is a DICOM
        acronym for frame comment, the DICOM field used for storing the
        inversion type descriptions
    picker_sel:
        list of positions of selective inversions in the acquisition
    picker_nonsel:
        list of positions of non-selective inversions in the acquisition
        
    Notes
    -----    
    Assuming the acqusition is as currently specified, for a given TI, there is
    always one selective inversion and one non-selective inversion. The
    perf_fair_fitter function assumes this. If this is not the case then it
    will fail, and so will the whole perfusion processing procedure. So the
    length of ti must be the same as picker_sel and picker_nonsel. The long_ti
    and fc outputs are diagnostic in case something goes wrong.

    # difficult to envisage a scenario where this would be needed. the
    # *_ptbl.txt file has a specific format created by
    # sammba.io_conversions.dcm_to_nii. if someone supplies their own file
    # name, it would mean they changed the *_ptbl.txt name (why?) or they have

    Notes
    ----- 
    Levenberg-Marquardt (method='lm'), the usual literature algorithm, cannot
    be used here as the implementation in scipy does not accept bounds. From
    experience with the R MINPACK implementation (minpack.lm function nlsLM),
    these bounds are necessary to assure good fitting. The lmfit python package
    does implement bounds for MINPACK Levenberg-Marquardt (method=leastsq;
    default), though the results appear to be worse than for TRR
    (method=least_squares), whose results bizarrely look closer to those of R
    minpack.lm nlsLM (to confirm), and are of course identical to
    scipy.optimize.least_squares with method='trf' (default).
